The project was made to learn and develop skills in React. What the project does is bring pokemon products from a database made in Firebase and renders them on the page.

In the shopping cart you can delete the product you want or empty the entire cart, you can also finish the purchase and go to the last details in which it asks you for an email and a cell phone to complete the purchase, in which it finally returns a purchase ID number
